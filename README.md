# SFM_public_version
The project is an energy-saving solution to control air conditioners using IoT.
The solution is based on two devices developed using ESP8266 board.
Admin_device:
This device contains sensors to detect open windows and people's presence in the room in order to automate the air conditioner functioning and save energy.
The device is also the link between the user and the air conditioner (the user can command multiple air conditioners at the same time using the app).
Installateur_device:
The device is used to add the user's air conditioners to the database (configuration, location, brand, remote control hexadecimal codes...).

PS: I deleted some portions of the code because I canâ€™t share it as it is.
